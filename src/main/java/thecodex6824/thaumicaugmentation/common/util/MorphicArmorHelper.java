/*
 * This is intentionally implemented as raw NBT tags rather than a capability.
 * Forge never really addressed how to sync ItemStack capabilities properly.
 * They say to use the share tag on the item, but you can't exactly do that if it's not your item.
 * Go ahead and search "capability sync" on the Forge github if you want to see a graveyard of PRs and
 * issues closed by their stale bot that were for addressing this. Would have been nice to do this the
 * right way, but it just isn't feasible to independently keep track of every itemstack and its capabilities.
